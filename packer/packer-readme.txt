builders: Uses the docker builder to create a Docker image based on python:3.10-slim.
provisioners:

    The first shell provisioner updates the package list and installs necessary build tools.
    The file provisioner copies the application code from the app directory into the Docker image.
    The second shell provisioner installs the Python dependencies from requirements.txt.

post-processors: Tags the final Docker image with the name my-fastapi-app:latest.
Customizations: Replace "my-fastapi-app" with your desired image name.
Dependencies: Make sure requirements.txt in the /app directory contains all necessary Python dependencies.

packer/install-dependencies.sh
This script is used by Packer to prepare the Docker image environment before installing Python dependencies.
apt-get update: Updates the package list to ensure the latest packages are installed.
apt-get install: Installs essential build tools needed to compile any Python packages that require C extensions.
apt-get clean & rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*: Cleans up unnecessary files to reduce the size of the Docker image.

packer/scripts/setup-app.sh
cd /app: Navigates to the application directory where the FastAPI app code is located.
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt: Installs all the Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt without caching to reduce image size.
Echo statement: Outputs a confirmation message indicating that the application setup is complete.
This script is used by Packer to set up the application after the base dependencies are installed.
Ensure that the requirements.txt file is in the /app directory with all necessary packages listed.
