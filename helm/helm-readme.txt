The file extension for YAML files can be either .yaml or .yml, and both are valid. It's a matter of personal or organizational preference, and Kubernetes, Helm, and most tools that work with YAML are compatible with either extension. However, it's generally recommended to stick to one convention for consistency across your project.
Common Practice:

    .yaml: This is more commonly used and is the official extension as per the YAML specification.
    .yml: Still widely used and accepted, but slightly less common.

For your Helm chart, using .yaml is the preferred and more common choice. So, you should name it chart.yaml.


chart.yaml
apiVersion: The version of the Helm chart API to use (v2 for Helm 3).
name: The name of the Helm chart (my-fastapi-app).
description: A brief description of the Helm chart.
version: The version of the Helm chart itself (used for versioning the chart).
appVersion: The version of the application being deployed (e.g., 1.0.0).


values.yaml
    replicaCount: The default number of replicas for your FastAPI application.
    image: Configuration for your Docker image:
        repository: The name of your Docker image. Replace this with your image name from your container registry.
        tag: The tag of the image to pull. Replace latest with a specific tag if necessary.
        pullPolicy: Specifies when to pull the image (e.g., IfNotPresent, Always, or Never).
    service: Configuration for the Kubernetes Service:
        type: LoadBalancer to expose the service externally.
        port: The external port to expose.
        targetPort: The port on the container where your FastAPI app is running (8000).
    resources: Resource requests and limits for the container.
    ingress: Configuration for Ingress:
        enabled: Set to true to enable Ingress.
        annotations: Annotations for the Nginx Ingress controller.
        hosts: The domain name(s) for your application. Replace myapp.example.com with your actual domain.
        tls: TLS configuration for secure connections. Replace myapp-tls with your TLS secret name and domain.
    autoscaling: Configuration for horizontal pod autoscaling:
        enabled: Set to true to enable autoscaling.
        minReplicas and maxReplicas: The minimum and maximum number of replicas.
        targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: The target CPU utilization percentage for scaling.
    nodeSelector, tolerations, and affinity: Configuration for scheduling pods on specific nodes or based on certain conditions.


    image.repository and image.tag: Replace with your actual Docker image and tag.
    ingress.hosts: Update with your domain name and adjust the TLS settings if needed.
    service.type: If you donâ€™t need external access, you can change this to ClusterIP or NodePort.
    resources: Adjust resource requests and limits based on the needs of your application.


helm/templates
helm/templates directory contains Kubernetes manifest templates used by Helm to generate the final YAML files that are applied to your cluster. These templates are written in YAML and use Go templating syntax to inject values from values.yaml and other Helm mechanisms.
Common Files in helm/templates

    deployment.yaml:
        Template for the Kubernetes Deployment resource that defines how your application pods are created and managed.
        Uses values from values.yaml for configuring the number of replicas, container image, resource limits, etc.

service.yaml
Template for the Kubernetes Service resource that exposes your application.
Configures the service type, ports, and selector.

ingress.yaml:

    Template for the Kubernetes Ingress resource to manage external access to your application.
    Configures hosts, paths, and TLS settings using values from values.yaml


_helpers.tpl:

    A file for defining reusable template helpers and functions to simplify your templates.
    Often used to define consistent naming conventions for resources.



configmap.yaml (Optional):

    Template for a ConfigMap resource if your application requires configuration files or environment settings.

secret.yaml (Optional):

    Template for a Secret resource if your application needs to store sensitive information like passwords or API keys.

    deployment.yaml: Defines how your application is deployed (e.g., replicas, containers, resource limits).
    service.yaml: Configures how your application is exposed (e.g., LoadBalancer, ports).
    ingress.yaml: Manages external access to your application.
    _helpers.tpl: Contains helper templates for consistency.
    configmap.yaml and secret.yaml: Used for application configuration and sensitive data, if needed.

    Modify these templates to match your application's requirements.
    Use the .Values object to dynamically inject values from values.yaml.

        automated: Enables automated synchronization of the application:
            prune: Deletes resources not defined in the Git repository.
            selfHeal: Automatically corrects drift if a resource is modified manually.
